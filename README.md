# svelte-blog-hash-router-example

An example repository showcasing how one might implement a basic client side hash router in svelte, including the ability to partially match a route to display dynamically generated pages such as blog posts.

This was just a quick project to provide an alternative answer to [a stack overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/57252673/5566053), and for me to teach myself and try out some things because I'm brand new to Svelte.

I haven't spent any time 'cleaning' this code, and it is by no means an example of best practices in Svelte or even web development in general :laughing:

Fork and tweak to your heart's content!

FYI, the project was bootstrapped using `npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project`
